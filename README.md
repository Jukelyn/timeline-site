# Xmas Project 2024

This repository contains a timeline project that showcases events or milestones along with images. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive scrolling timeline with fade-in effects and image transitions.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file, containing the structure for the timeline and favicon links.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the page, including the timeline, containers, and media queries for responsiveness.
- **fade.js**: JavaScript that handles the fade-in and slide-up animations for the timeline containers on scroll.

## Features

- **Interactive Timeline**: A timeline with images and text that reveals new events as you scroll.
- **Responsive Design**: The timeline is fully responsive, ensuring it looks good on mobile devices as well as larger screens.
- **Favicon Support**: Multiple favicons are included for different browsers and platforms (SVG and PNG).
- **Fade & Transition Effects**: Timeline containers fade and slide into view when they become visible on the screen.
